* Docker images let you build against the API in your own Javascript framework with extremely minimal setup. See [this project, a matrix row coder that can run on your desktop, or be integrated natively into TaxonWorks](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/matrix_row_coder).
 
* Code generators let you stub a new task view (core feature) or batch-loader in a single line.  
  
* TaxonWorks is built on Rails. The conventions there acts a wrapper around features that can be written in Ruby or other cutting edge tools like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Elm](), or other webpack supported frameworks.

* TaxonWorks is extensively unit tested.  This means you can code and contribute with a lot less fear of breaking things.

* TaxonWorks is deployed in production in Kubernetes.  This means you 
 
* The Species File Group and its members have held hackatons and many in-house joint workshops. Contact them if you're interested in participating.  They are also interested in supporting visits to would-be developers, students, or others wishing to get a bootcamp in TaxonWorks development.

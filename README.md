Tired of reading all this stuff? Can't find what you are looking for? Talk to a human, [![Gitter][1]][2].

This is the current hub for documentation on TaxonWorks ([homepage](http://taxonworks.org), [source](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks)).  

## Registry

The [registry](REGISTRY.md) is where you can find a place to start a TaxonWorks project.

## Installation

Get started quickly with [install_taxonworks instructions](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/install_taxonworks).  Instructions for "native" (non-docker based) installs are also maintained there.

## Code documentation

[Rdoc](https://rdoc.taxonworks.org) based on inline documentation is generated on each commit of the code to the development branch.

### API

See [taxonworks_api](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_api).

## Conceptual documentation

See Rdoc (link above).  Conceptual bits are also being described in [/concepts/README.md](/concepts).

## Manuals

Help currently currently exists within the application.  Click the orange semicircle on the bottom left whenever it is glowing.  As the project matures we plan to have more concetrated manuals, SOPs etc. recorded as videos, or perhaps wiki pages, etc.

## Frequently asked questions

The [FAQ](FAQ.md) is just getting started. 

## Contributing

No [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) is too small!

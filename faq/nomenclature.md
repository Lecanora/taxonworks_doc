# FAQ - Nomenclature

## Can you describe how the authorship label for a name is determined?

Authorship of a name can asserted in 4(!) different ways. That seems confusing at first, but determining what gets shown is pretty straightforwrd.

The authorship label is determined by the FIRST option in the following list that is true. All other values are referenced only in validation reports.

* If the `verbatim name` field is filled out, then it is used.
* If People are assigned as TaxonName authors, then their family names are used.
* If People are assigned to a Source as authors, and that Source is the original source for the taxon name, then their family group names are used.
* If the `author` field of a Source is filled out, then that field is used.

## There are a lot of options for assigning the authorship of a TaxonName, which is the preferred way?

The preferred mechanism is to link the TaxonName to a Source, and assign authors (People) to that source (third option in the list above).  This is the most granular way of creating the data, and therefor it will ultimately give you the most flexibility in reporting and validating the data.

## Is it possible to link a note to a family group name to specify what the original spelling is, at what level it was proposed and when?

##  Do you have any instructions on how to change combinations or enter new synonymies in TW?

## How do I find out where types are deposited, do you not yet have this function in TW?

## I am still confused by what you mean by basonym. Do you mean the name (and combination) as originally proposed when that name was first made available (as the botanists use it), or do you mean the name as used in specified publication?

## How do I get to the place in TW where I can add a new basonym? I need to try it out and see what happens.

## How would I remove a name from synonymy? 

## How would I place this name in synonymy? 

## What is the word form for "arbitrary combination of letters"

The word form is "noun in apposition"; etymology "arbitrary combination of letters"

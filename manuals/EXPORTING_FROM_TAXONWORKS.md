# Exporting from TaxonWorks

This is version _0.0.1_. All changes beyond grammar will result in an increment. Higher level increments reflect larger changes that may reflect new ways of doing things, or differences in user interfaces, etc.

_You can ask for help and clarification live in person on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks)!_

## Overview

_Everything here is currently available in TaxonWorks, i.e. it contains no "future" work._

This manual details how to export data curated in TaxonWorks via number of different mechanisms.  

## Exercise target audience

Curators who have compiled data that they now want to share, or do new Science with.

## Exercise goals

The goals are to describe:


* Where to find exports of CSV formats
* Where to find exports of data standards (e.g. DwCA, BibTeX, Nexus, CoLDP)
* Where to find exports of raw/native TaxonWorks tables
* Where to find export functionality via the public facing "API" 
* Where to find export functionality via internal JSON serving endpointd

At the end of the exercise you should: 

* Export a wide range of data for downstream use 

## Assumptions

* We assume you are familiar with navigating TaxonWorks
* We assume you are able to load a CSV file into Excel, or some other database
* For some exports we assume you are familiar with handling JSON data
* For some exports we assume you are familiar with the standard in question (e.g. DWCA)
 
## Gotchas

* Export functionality is rapidly evolving and expanding. There will be a multitude of improvements, enhancements, and new mechanisms coming as TaxonWorks evolves. Please see issues labeled with [Export](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/labels/export).

## Tips

* Tools like [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) are a great way to explore your CSV data
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is an awesome command line parser for JSON (and other tools like it exist as well)

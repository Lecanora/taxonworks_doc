# Nomenclature basics

_This manual provided a basic cheat-sheet for gettings started with the nomenclature interfaces as they *currently* exist._

## Accessing the functionality

* Navigate to the Tasks list.
* Use the filter (on the left) to select 'Nomenclature" related tasks
* Currently useful tasks are yellow ( red = experiment, works, but might not last, or might radically change; yellow = more or less stable, some changes anticipated but basic functionality will remain same; green=you can write a manual, won't change for any reason)

## Curating data

### Name and classification

### Authorship

### Status ("asserted")

### Relationships (e.g. synonymy) to other names

### Original combinations

### Type metadata

### Citations

## Navigation helpers

## Help

* _Their is currently NO useful help from the orange slideout on the right, this will change as text appears here and migrates to the native help system._

## Understanding the data model

* Concepts, at a low level, are gradually being documented here https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_doc/tree/master/concepts (see the TaxonWorksNomenclature.pdf, you can zoom in to see details).

## Nomenclature, not biology

* A reminder, if you want to record information about biology (hosts, parasites, distribution, etc.) that doesn't belong in the nomenclature section, you will use the Otu radial icon or OTU nav icon to access and record those data from a nomenclatural context.

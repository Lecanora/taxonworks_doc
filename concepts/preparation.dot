  # Treatment
  # The treatment is the process of physically altering the specimen _by a curator_ prior to the CollectionObjects current physical state.
  # Current proxy: Protocol.
  # Target implementation: Protocol, ProtocolSteps
  Treatment

  # Container
  # A physical (with one exception) that "localized" collection objects.  "Localizes": if you find the container, the probability of finding the specimen increases. Containers nest if a) it is physically possible and b) by nesting the probability of finding the CollectionObject increases.

  Container

  # Proximity
  # Proximity is temporary attribute to indicate the difference between "Bulk" and non-bulk assertions
  # Current proxy: Preparation type label
  # Target implementation: inferred, not asserted by inspection of CollectionObject#total and Container
  Proximity

  # Matrix 
  # The matrix is the immediate surrounding of the CollectionObject, what surrounds it.
  # Current proxy: Preparation type label
  # Target implementation: `matrix` attribute on PreparationSpace drawn from Matrix ontology/CVT
  Matrix

  # Environment 
  # The Environment is the sum of the attributes that describe the the space within, or encompassing the Container the CollectionObject is in.
  # Current proxy: Preparation type label.
  # Target implementation: `environment` attribute on PreparationSpace
  Environment

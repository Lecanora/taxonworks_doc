# The big picture 

_The view from 30K feet at TaxonWorks and why this online documentation tool._

## Vision and mission

Our vision is a world in which the descriptions of Earth's life permeates humanity.

Our mission is to make TaxonWorks, and its companions, as excellent as those that describe life on Earth. As the requirements, needs, and goals for those that describe life evolve, so too should the resources and tools that facilitate their work.

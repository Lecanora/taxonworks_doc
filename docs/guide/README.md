# The big picture 

_The view from 30K feet at TaxonWorks and why this online documentation tool._

## Vision and mission
From the Species File Group, and TaxonWorks, we work toward realizing a vision for open, shared taxonomic information for all.

Our mission encompasses building software tools that facilitate cataloging, describing, and studying life on Earth. We work toward realizing a connected taxonomic, collections, and software development community around products like TaxonWorks -- an integrated web-based workbench for taxonomists and biodiversity scientists. Read more about our philosophical ideas and current progress at [TaxonWorks.org](https://taxonworks.org/).

# Digitization

_TaxonWorks offers taxonomists, collections staff, and others to collectively manage vouchered collections data._

Uniquely in TaxonWorks, we make it easy up-front to add customized fields (aka "data attributes") where needed. In addtion, in TW you can upload data mapped to Darwin Core, to specific fields in TW, and to these customized data attributes you add.

## Comprehensive Digitization

To get a sense of what can be tracked regarding specimens in your collection, see the Comprehensive Digitization Task in TW outlined next. Note also that you may enter data into TW record-by-record, or in batch mode (see Import and Export).

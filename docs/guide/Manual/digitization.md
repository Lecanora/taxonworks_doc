# Digitization

_TaxonWorks offers taxonomists, collections staff, and others to collectively manage vouchered collections data._

Uniquely in TaxonWorks, we make it easy up-front to add customized fields (aka "data attributes") where needed. In addtion, in TW you can upload data mapped to Darwin Core, to specific fields in TW, and to these customized data attributes you add.

## Digitization Quick Start
TW provides a suite of common tasks help you to manage your digitization and related data. This section assumes you have some familiarity with the [TW user interface conventions](/guide/Manual/conventions.html) and introduces new user interface features where needed. First, please familiarize yourself with the kinds of tasks TW offers. 

## Comprehensive Digitization

To get a sense of what can be tracked regarding specimens in your collection, see the Comprehensive Digitization Task in TW outlined next. Note also that you may enter data into TW record-by-record, or in batch mode (see Import and Export).

## Label Printing
There are many places where you can print labels from different tasks in TaxonWorks, including unit trays, specimen labels, and identifiers. The main task where you manage what is finally printed is `Print Labels`, but labels are generated within a variety of other tasks.

### Printing Header Labels
#left[**Legend**: Filter Nomenclature Task Box](https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/l3hbqm [screenshot of the TaxonWorks Task Filter Nomenclature Button])
- To create a set of new header labels.
  - Search for `Filter Nomenclature` search bar and click the task box. 
  - Use the various search parameters on the left to create a list of names you want to have on header labels.
    - For example, you can select a higher taxon, then check `descendents` to include all of its children.
    - Or, you can search for a group, and then choose to only find names of a specific taxonomic level, like "Genus group" or "Species group".

  - Once you have a list of names you want to create header labels for, check the `Select All` Box or select individual names. 
  - Then, click the `Radial Label` icon at the top right, and click the `Unit Tray` option. #right[Legend: Radial Label](https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/1t0yrt [radial label button])

# The User Interface

_TaxonWorks offers conventions via a unique user interface building in forward-aware methods like automated data validation to aid navigation and data fitness._

## Philosophy

- [ ] TW seeks to offer a user interface that is as intuitive as possible that supports elegant software features to improve both the experience and the data products.
- [ ] This guide and manual exemplify one way in which the Species File Group and TaxonWorks endeavor to build a sustainable, open, transparent community. The software and process for building and maintaining the content here were selected specifically for ease of community curation of this resource.
- [ ]  The structure, tasks, and features of TW focus on addressing specifically-stated needs of those using the product. We use an agile, "epic story" approach that can be summarized as: _As a [your role], I want to do [your task], in order to accomplish [some product]._
- [ ] Note color conventions used in the TW UI offer information to orient the observer to more information (e.g. this task is still under development, or these data are shared across projects).

[STEPS here]

## Inside a Project
Note that once you log into a given project, you see 3 options for interacting with others and data. See the **Tasks**, **Data**, and **Favorites** tabs. 

The **Tasks** provide you with one-click access to working on a specific goal such as _Filter Sources_ or _Comprehensive Digitization_. 
- currently [number of] tasks exist in TW
- tasks can be customized
- new tasks can be written
- you can search tasks
- tasks are associated with given global concepts (e.g. Nomenclature, Sources, Digitiation, etc.)

With the **Favorites** tab feature, you can store your most-used tasks (aka activities) for quick access to what you do most often.

The **Data** tab provides you with more of a traditional _table_ view of information as stored in TW. Here you begin to get a sense of how the data are structured and related in TW. 

If you would like more details about the TW Data Model, see the [Data](https://docs.taxonworks.org/develop/Data/) section of docs.taxonworks.org

### Try it

With your knowledge of the **Tasks**, **Data**, and **Favorites** structure you can try these actions.

1. Find a **Task** of interest, click on the _star_ and then click on the **Favorites** tab. You'll see this task listed now for easy access.

2. ...

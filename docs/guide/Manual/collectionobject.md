# Collection Objects
_A place for information about specimens and related collection items_.

As a researcher, as an ecologist, as a collection manager, you want to gather, access, learn from, manage, (and later, share) data describing the `Collection Objects` (CO) that you steward. Inside TaxonWorks the CollectionObject model offers you a rich set of concepts and the ability to add custom `Data Attributes` as needed to store and share more data.

## Collection Object related tasks

`New collection cbject Task`: This task suits digitization data capture workflows designed to support use of stub or skeletal records. Minimal data captured here, including text blocks, can be parsed later.

`New Collecting Event Task`: In addition to the data about the `what` (that is, the physical specimen itself), information about the `where`, `how`, `who`, and `when`, etcetera fit elsewhere in the TaxonWorks data model: the `New Collecting Event (CE) Task` stores information about the where, when, and who.

`Comprehensive specimen digitization Task` (CSD): Combined into one screen, much of the data you have related to a specimen can be entered inside this one window. Inside this task, you have access to `buffered data` from stub records and `verbatim` data that can be parsed for you. You'll find you can add people, locality information, biological association data, and add custom fields you need. The following screenshot highlights the different sections of this task in TaxonWorks.

### Customize the layout and reorder fields
In the top right of the above screenshot, note the options to change the layout of the `Comprehensive specimen digitization` task. Using these options, you can hide some content if not wanted or needed and move fields into a more optimum order for your data capture strategy.

#### Layout settings
- Click on `Layout settings` in the top right of the `Comprehensive specimen digitization` task.
- In the pop-up (see next), `select the sections` you want to display. Any un-checked sections do not appear on your screen.

#left[Inside this Pop-up, a checked box means that section of the CSD will display](https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/siaosk[a pop-up allowing users to decide with sections of the CSD tasks to use or hide])

#### Collection object section inside `Comprehensive specimen digitization Task`
In the top section of the CSD screenshot, you see sections for `Catalog number`, `Repository`, `Preparation`, `Buffered`, and `Depictions`.


`Catalog number`: TW provides several ways for you to add `Catalog numbers` to ensure you can find or subset your CO items as needed. Note the `Namespace` concept in TW which keeps `Catalog numbers` unique inside a TW Project.
- Select an existing `Namespace` for this CO or add a `New` one if needed
  - You can `Search` to find the one you want.
  - `Recent` offers you items you've selected not too long ago.
  - `Pinboard` gives you the option to attach a given `Namespace` to the foreseeable items you plan to add at the moment.
- Add your `Catalog number` identifier.
- `Check` the `increment` box if you want to create records with numbers that increase accordingly.

`Repository`: 

`Preparation`:

`Buffered`:

`Depictions`:

#### Determinations section inside `Comprehensive specimen digitization Task`

`Operational Taxonomic Unit` (OTU): 
- Select the taxon concept applied (the `Determination`) to the specimen.
  - Quick
  - Recent
  - Pinboard
- Search to select the name of the person who identified the specimen.
- Enter the date (as much as you know) the `Determination` was done.
- Click `Add`

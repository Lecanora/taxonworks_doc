# Start a project

Before you start a project it is important to understand:

* TaxonWorks is open-source software that can be installed by anyone who wishes to.
* There is no one central TaxonWorks installation.
* One installation (sometimes referred to as "an instance") of TaxonWorks supports the creation of many projects.
* Organizations or individuals who collaborate with you by sharing their installation of TaxonWorks are doing this on their own terms. These terms may vary.

## Finding a collaborating provider

The following is a list of organizations or individuals with TaxonWorks installations.

_If you wish to be added to this list contact us or make a [pull request](/about/glossary#pull-request)._

| Provider | Contact |Shares sandbox? | Accepting collaborators? | 
|-|-|-|-|
| [Species File Group](https://speciesfilegroup.org) | [Deborah Paul](mailto:dlpaul@illinois.edu)| yes | yes |

## New projects in sandboxes

Some providers (see above) offer accounts in "sandboxes", i.e. test or example use.  _Each provider may have their own conditions as to how a sandbox should be used, be sure to understand the terms of use before using a sandbox account._ Please read:
* [Sandbox Terms of Use](https://speciesfilegroup.org/docs/taxonworks_sandboxes_at_sfg.html)
* [TW Memorandum of Understanding](https://speciesfilegroup.org/docs/taxonworks_in_production_at_sfg.html)

## Manging your own instance of TaxonWorks

### Running your own server

At present see the [install_taxonworks repository](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/install_taxonworks).

### Offline/local use

Is possible to use TaxonWorks locally, for example developers have active instances they work with.

Considerations:

* Offline use is not officially suported at the moment, however the core developers are open to discussing making this happen.
* Offline TaxonWorks runs slower than online, however if you are serious about making it work the developers can work with you to tune your setup.
* Besides the various means of import and export there are no direct syncronization methods from offline to online projects.

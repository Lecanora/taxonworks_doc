# Citing TaxonWorks

_There are many ways to cite TaxonWorks, products derived from the software, and more. Here we offer general guidelines and some specific examples._

## General Citation Guidance
A generalized citation showing what each part needs to contain:

`<who, "community" or "individuals>`. `<year>`. `<project title, as seen in TW>` curated in TaxonWorks [software]. `<optional maintainer statement>`. Accessed on `<date>` from `<url, e.g. https://sfg.taxonworks.org/>`.

Note optional roles: author(s), editors (maintainer) where best practices include: a)everyone is an author, and b) keep it flat.

Best practices expect one to include the following when _citing data sources_ (see <a href="https://library.cumc.columbia.edu/insight/citing-data-sources" target="_blank">Citing data sources</a>):   
- author(s), 
- date of pub
- title of dataset
- publisher or distributor
- PID/identifiers
- version, when appropriate
- date accessed, when appropriate

## Software

### The software (collective)
e.g. TaxonWorks Community. 2022. Taxonworks [software and supporting resources], https://taxonworks.org. Species File Group (maintainers, https://speciesfilegroup.org). Accessible at: https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks.
### The collective code in the TaxonWorks repository (all, version free)
e.g. TaxonWorks Community. 2022. Taxonworks [software]. Species File Group (maintainers, https://speciesfilegroup.org). Accessible at: https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks.
### The collective code in TaxonWorks at a specific version
e.g. TaxonWorks Community. 2022. Taxonworks [software]. Species File Group (maintainers, https://speciesfilegroup.org). Version 0.22.1. Accessible at: https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks.
### The help documentation
e.g. TaxonWorks Community. 2022. Taxonworks [documentation]. Accessed `<timestamp>` at https://docs.taxonworks.org.

Abstract:
  The non-code, but digital (captured and available somewhere, e.g. Issue tracker), contributions to the TaxonWorks community (e.g. opening issues, adding help documentation, etc.)
  The non-code, and not digital, contributions, e.g. people we talked with that gave us ideas (has to be captured somewhere, e.g. personal communications)

## Data

For each citation consider the following possibilities / options for citing:  
  1- a) some data; b) all data  
  2- a) data retrieved in real time; b) archived somewhere { WHERE }  
  3- a) data Via API; b) native TW interface; c) Via some public interface { HOW }; d) after some time at Zenodo   

### Use Cases
- citing data in any instance of TaxonWorks, ever, destroyed or not (cross project)  
- citing data in a single instance of TaxonWorks  
- citing data in a single project

# The big picture

_Why emphasize that software development in science is big-picture important? How are the resources available to developers described here?_

## How is TaxonWorks supporting developer contributions?
A project the nature of TaxonWorks needs contributions from many people to succeed over the long term. To that end we're working hard to build a foundation that permits and encourages anyone to contribute to the project. Highlights include:
* All elements of the project are open source.
* Example meta-projects exist, for example [taxonowrks_stats](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_stats) ([demo](https://stats.taxonworks.org)) illustrating how to build an application off of the API 
* Code generators let you stub a new task view (core feature) or batch-loader in a single line.  
* TaxonWorks is built on Rails. The conventions there acts a wrapper around features that can be written in Ruby or other frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or other webpack supported frameworks.
* TaxonWorks is extensively unit tested.  This means you can code and contribute with a lot less fear of breaking things.
* TaxonWorks is deployed in production in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), cutting edge application deployment and management software.
* The [Species File Group](https://speciesfilegroup.org) and its members have held hackathons and many in-house joint workshops. Contact them if you're interested in participating on site.  They are also interested in supporting visits to would-be developers, students, or others wishing to get a bootcamp in TaxonWorks development.
* Docker images let you build against the API in your own JavaScript framework with extremely minimal setup.

# Bug reporting

Where to file your issue if it regards:
* TaxonWorks the software - [issue tracker here](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/issues)
* TaxonWorks Docs (these pages) - [issue tracker is here](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_docs/issues)
* TaxonWorks API - [issue tracker is here](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_api/issues)

## Considerations when reporting a bug or adding a feature request
Before you open an issue:
* Check to see that the issue is indeed new by carefully reviewing the existing issues.

While filing your issue:
* Use a issue template if available, this categorizes your insights into more actionable items for those seeking to address it
* Tell a story! Give us enough background so that we can replicate exactly what you did. 
* Include a success criterion.  How do we know we've succeeded in addressing the issues without contacting you again?
* Err on providing more, rather than less information.
* Provide a meaningful title that identifies your role, and what you seek to accomplish, e.g. `As an X I need Y to do Z`

Some other conventions:
  * If you have the permissions, categorize your issue using a label.
  * Use the prefix "Task -" in the name to indicate the request for a new or improved task.

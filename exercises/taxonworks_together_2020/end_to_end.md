# End to end session

## Goals

Discuss and rapidly demo 4 elements of what you can do, end to end:

* Rails console
* API development
* Scripting via Rake tasks
* Unit tests 
  
## Pre-requisites
_Each of these steps has their own pre-requisites that are not repeated here. _

* A working development environment

## Rails console
* Like 'irb', but with the TaxonWorks environment

## API development
* Routes
* Controllers
  * Actions
* Response template

* Advanced: looking to 2.0

### Exercise - an endpoint for instance stats

## Rake tasks
* Like having Rails console, but in a script
* Demo integration

### Exercise 
* Write a CSV file with some people metadata 

## Unit tests
* As example code
* As best practices/sanity checks
* TaxonWorks test helpers
  * Factory's and their naming conventions
* When?
  * Models
  * Features

## Next steps 
* TaxonWorks is a [Rails App](https://rubyonrails.org/). Other notable Rails apps in whole or part: iNaturalist, EOL, Github, Gitlab, Shopify.

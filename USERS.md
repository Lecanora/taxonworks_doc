# Users

The documentation for TaxonWorks users is obviously in its early stages.  Ultimately we have envisioned multiple help resources of different types, variously integrated. Some of the concepts for these resources are emerging below. We ulimately expect to unify documentation within a single website.

## Contributing
Remember, we want it to be possible for our users to also help in the development of TaxonWorks. No [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) is too small!

## In application help
Use the orange question mark slideout on the right of the interface.

## Manuals
Manuals are detailed documents targeting specific workflows. See [here](/manuals/README.md).

## Cheatsheets
_Use the PDF button to download a version._

## Conceptual documentation
Conceptual bits are being described in [/concepts/README.md](/concepts).  For those of you brave enough our [code documentation](http://rdoc.taxonworks.org) also contains a significant amount of information on our data models.

## Frequently asked questions
See the [FAQs](faq/README.md).

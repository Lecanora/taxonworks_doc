# Users

The documentation for TaxonWorks users is obviously in its early stages.  Ultimately we have envisioned multiple help resources of different types, variously integrated. Some of the concepts for these resources are emerging below. We ulimately expect to unify documentation within a single website.

## Contributing
Remember, we want it to be possible for our users to also help in the development of TaxonWorks. No [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) is too small!

## Registry
The [registry](REGISTRY.md) is where you can find a place to start a TaxonWorks project.

## In application help
Use the orange question mark slideout on the right of the interface.

## Manuals
Manuals are detailed documents targeting specific workflows. See [here](/manuals/README.md).

## Videos
There is a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKNr7QYwvVFcRfQAcMEAhLw) channel with a couple small videos.

## Cheatsheets
_Use the PDF button to download a version._
* [Cheatsheet 1 - Interface overview](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xttgxvcnwcpz)

## Glossary
* [A glossary](GLOSSARY.md) includes definitions for words that users have heard in the context of TaxonWorks (and other biodiversity informatics related) discussions.

## Conceptual documentation
Conceptual bits are being described in [/concepts/README.md](/concepts).  For those of you brave enough our [code documentation](http://rdoc.taxonworks.org) also contains a significant amount of information on our data models.

## Frequently asked questions
See the [FAQs](faq/README.md).

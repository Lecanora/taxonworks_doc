# USERS

The documentation for TaxonWorks users is obviously in its early stages.  Ultimately we have envisioned multiple help resources of different types, variously integrated. Some of the concepts for these resources are emerging below.

## Contributing

Remember, we want it to be possible for our users to also help in the development of TaxonWorks. No [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) is too small!

## Registry

The [registry](REGISTRY.md) is where you can find a place to start a TaxonWorks project.

## The future: a dedicated website for TaxonWorks documentation

We ulimately expect to unify documentation within a single website.

## In application help

Use the orange question mark slideout on the right of the interface.

## Manuals

See [here](/manuals/README.md).

## Cheatsheets

_Use the PDF button to download a version._

## Conceptual documentation

Conceptual bits are being described in [/concepts/README.md](/concepts).  For those of you brave enough our [code documentation](http://rdoc.taxonworks.org) also contains a significant amount of information on our data models.

## Frequently asked questions

The [FAQ](FAQ.md) is just getting started.
